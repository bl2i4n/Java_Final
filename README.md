# Java_Final

In this project for CS-170 at Ohlone we decided to remake a popular hit on the Apple App store. We decided to make "Flappy Bird" using Java swing for the UI, and for the images we used photoshop to create our very own bird, background and obstacles.

This project had to have an educational motivation so if you lost the game you would have to spell a randomized word to continue playing. The game also had a built in leaderboard.
